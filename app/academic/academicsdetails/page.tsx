                  A school club is a group of students who come together to
                  pursue a common interest or goal. Joining a school club offers
                  students the opportunity to build friendships, develop
                  leadership qualities, and learn new skills outside the
                  classroom. Participation in clubs not only enhances a
                  studentâ€™s overall personality but also strengthens their
                  college applications and prepares them for future careers.

                  There are a variety of school clubs available â€” from art and
                  music to science, literature, and community service â€” each
                  designed to nurture different talents and passions.
